# Creative Project for CS260

This is my creative project for CS260--Web Programming. It will be my main 
website to hold all of my projects. I am very excited to finally create my own
website, and it has been on my bucket list for several years now.

In this readme, I just want to give a few notes to those who may be reading my
code.

## CSS

I have opted out of using bootstrap for my main css styling. Instead of 
bootstrap, I am writing my own css using [sass]. I have realized after the 
fact that we are supposed to use bootstrap for our navigation. I hope that it 
is ok that I use my own bootstrap inspired css instead.
