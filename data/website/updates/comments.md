I have added comments to the website. They are not yet fully functional, but
the structure is there. If I want to continue with a comment system, then I
will have to make an active server to store the comments.

This is of course for a class, and I wonder if we will learn about creating 
servers.

If you notice anything that should change, I would say to leave a comment, but
I wouldn't be able to see it!
