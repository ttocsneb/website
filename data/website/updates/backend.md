I have finally gotten to making a backend. It doesn't do too much, but it gets
the job done. There are still a few things that need to be done; most notably
adding support to view your account, make changes to your account, and reset 
your password when it is forgotten.

The things this shiny new backend does is as follows:

* Create accounts
* Create comments
* Edit Comments
* Delete Comments

I'm pretty sure that I have been able to solve most of the issues that arised 
from all of these changes, but if you find any, you can finally let me know!

Leave a comment down below if you feel like it, and I should hopefully see it.
