The website you are reading this project on is my website project. It is 
designed to hold all of my projects with updates to those proejcts. I could
have a wordpress blog--Which I have had in the past--but I've always had 
problems with these sites not supplying me with exactly what I am looking for.

#### Design

With this website, I can write out all the things that I want to have in my
website. One of the main points of my website is to have it be as static as
possible while still having some dynamic elements, e.g. all pages are 
statically generated, but comments are pulled from a ReST API.

#### What's to come

I am still very early on the design of my website, and I expect that there 
may be many changes to come in the future.
