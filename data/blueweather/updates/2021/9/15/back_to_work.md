So I haven't been working on BlueWeather for a little while now. I'm starting
to get the itch again to continue development on the project. In this update,
I'm going to go over a few things that I want to prioritize while working on 
BlueWeather.

The big thing to work on is the front-end. I need to decide how I want the 
front-end to act. Is it going to be a web-app where only API calls are made to 
the back-end? Is it going to be a back-end only application where any updates 
to the data require a refresh? Or is it going to be something in between those 
two?

At the moment, I like the idea of having a mix between the two options. I'm 
not sure how difficult that will actually end up being. Another important 
factor to think about is what kind of work will need to be made to allow 
plugins to get access to the front-end? The easiest solution for giving 
plugins access would be to have no front-end at all.

As I think about what I want do do about the front-end more and more: I want 
to have a cat, a cute cat. Meow meow cat.
