Gemcaps is an optimized server for the [gemini protocol][gemini]. I hope to
make this software easy to configure, but also highly configurable.

The gemini protocol aims to be simple and unextensible. I like that, however,
I want to have servers be extensible. I t would be nice to have a central
server that acts as a proxy to other servers in the same domain. To allow the
central server to cache pages to allow for quicker response times. Along with
so much more.
