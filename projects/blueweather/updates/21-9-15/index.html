        <p>
            So I haven't been working on BlueWeather for a little while now.
            I'm starting to get the itch again to continue development on the 
            project. In this update, I'm going to go over a few things that I
            want to prioritize while working on BlueWeather.
        </p>
        <p>
            The big thing to work on is the front-end. I need to decide how I
            want the front-end to act. Is it going to be a web-app where only
            API calls are made to the back-end? Is it going to be a back-end
            only application where any updates to the data require a refresh?
            Or is it going to be something in between those two?
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, I like the idea of having a mix between the two
            options. I'm not sure how difficult that will actually end up being.
            Another important factor to think about is what kind of work will
            need to be made to allow plugins to get access to the front-end?
            The easiest solution for giving plugins access would be to have no
            front-end at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I think about what I want do do about the front-end more and
            more: I want to have a cat, a cute cat. Meow meow cat.
